cwGraph class to use the methods of pChart to create fast charts
with basic knowledge of pChart library.

pChart library is required for usage.

This provides a layer of abstraction for other libraries but only 
pChart was implemented.

In the example directory can be found a basic example that I got
from old code using this class.

Example in:
src/php/example/example.php

Source in:
src/php/cwGraph.php

2 class's exists:

cwFont
